Case Study
5/14/2020
Shea, Justin, Alex

OBJECTIVE: To set up an active directory, file systems, and security for the company JQ Adams.

NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS: The first thing we did with this case study was come up with a file directory system
  for the company. This is what we came up with:
    JQ Adams
      Administration
      Finance
        Accounting
      Sales
        Marketing
      Production
        Team 1
        Team 2
      Quality Control
 
    

QUESTIONS:
1.    What questions would you ask the company to help you plan the Active Directory?
        Who are the top people that I could talk to to get the information I need?
        
        Are there any naming conventions?

2.    Describe your Active Directory structure including OUs, users and groups. 
      Include any assumptions you made about the company that affected your design. 
      You could use something like Visio to display the structure.)
      
      For our Active Directory, we didn't deviate very far from what was already shown in the company graph.
      

3.    Describe your file directory structure you created for the JQ Adams case study. 
      Indicate which folders are being shared.


4.    What is your naming policy for user accounts?


5.    Describe how you can delegate full control of managing production user accounts to the Production Vice President.


6.    Describe how you use global groups to group users together and then domain local groups to provide access to network resources. 
      For example, you could describe how you used this concept to provide access for finance users to the AcctSys folder.


7.    Generally speaking, what are the advantages of using global groups to manage users and then using domain local groups
      on the Security Tab to provide access?


8.    Why is it important to set disk quotas for users?


9.    Briefly describe how you setup DFS for your JQ Adams project.


10.  What are at least two advantages of using DFS?


11.  What group policies did you setup for this project?


12.  What information can you get from the GPresult tool?


13.  Describe how you can use Group Policy to distribute and control Chrome on the client computers.


14.  Explain how roaming profiles can be useful.


15.  Describe problems or issues you had while implementing this project.  How did you work around or overcome the problems?


16.  Write a conclusion/reflection about this case study. 
     Include what you learned and what you would do different if you were to start over on a similar project.  
     
     
CONCLUSION AND REFLECTION:
