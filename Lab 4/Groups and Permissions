Lab 4
2/27/20
Shea Clark, Alexandra

Objective: Create groups and adjust the permissions and security settings for the groups.

Notes and Observations: 
  For this lab we started by logging into winServer4/Server Manager/Tools/Active Directory Users and Computers/
  Create New OU called "Main".
  
  Inside of the Main OU create the OU's Marketing, HR, Accounting, and IT. Then moved out client users to IT OU.
  
  -Create 5 new users for our new OU's
    -sheamarketing@domain4.local
    -sheait@domain4.local
    -Alex created her own for accounting, HR, and marketing.
  -Added out client users to the domain admins under Users.
  -Create Global Group to each OU
    -MarketingGG
    -AccountingGG
    -HRGG
    -ITGG
  -Create Domain Local groups to each OU
    -MarketingDL
    -AccountingDL
    -HRDL
    -ITDL
  -Add the users from the OU's to the GG of each OU.
  -Add the GG to the DL group.
  -Create a folder on the desktop called "Data"
    -Create subfolders
      -Marketing DATA
      -Accounting DATA
      -HR DATA
      -IT DATA
  -For each of the folders go to properties/security and add the DL group of that type and give the DL full controll.
        security/edit/add/check names
        
Switch to the Client Console
  -Log onto Client as admin/search/local users and groups/groups/remote desktop/add domain users.
  -Logon to Client as Shea Marketing-Success!
  -Share our Top-Shelf folder "Data" on the winServer4 with domain users and give full control.
  
  Alex HR signed into Client and couldn't access the Data folder
  -went back to our server and went to properties/security for our Data folder and gave access-Success!
  -went to link and followed the instructions to add a printer to our server.
    https://www.tactig.com/install-configure-print-services-windows-server/
  -entered the printer id address and install driver called "generic". 
      Successfully print test page.
    Server/printers/Generic/Properties/Security/Remove Everyone/Add HR DL
   Signed in as Alex HR/folder/winServer4/printer/print test page-Success!

Conclusion and Reflection:
  This lab went more smoothly for us. It was interesting to see how these groups(GG, DL, Users) nest within 
  each other and how sharing a printer is not actually a lot of work, but is definitely a little bit of a 
  learning curve. There is a lot more involved than you might think. I think the best way to do this again
  woulbe be to have a check list and check things off as you go. The thing to remember as well is that even
  though you share a folder, the other server won't be able to see it until you set up the security settings.
