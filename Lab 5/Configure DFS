Objectives: To install and configure a DFS system with replication.

Questions:
  1. What advantages does DFS offer over regular folder shares?
    The structure of the DFS is much simpler than a file sharing system. It also allows you to replicate 
    to certain departments.
  
  2. What advantages does domain based namespace have over standalone DFS.
    When using a domain based namespace, you can use multiple namespace servers to host.
  
  3. What is the purpose of the referral server in DFS?  Why is it important to have a backup referral
  server?
    The purpose of a referral server in DFS is to provide reliable servers for the client. 
    It is important to have a backup referral server for when the clients computer fails to connect to the 
    first server, the client computer will attempt to access the next server. If that server is unavailable
    you can configure to have the client computer connect to the preferred server when it becomes available again.


Notes and Observations:
  Day 1
   -First we created a new VM called winServer4b
   -Change computer name
      system mng/computer name/winServer4b
   -Added ourselves into Domain 4
   -Enable remote access
   -Install active directory servers to add roles to our server
   -Promote server to Domain Controller in Deployment Config
   -sign in as admin
   -install DNS and reboot
 Day 2
   -Logon to winServer4b and remote access.
   -Created a folder on the desktop called "Top Shelf"
   -Made subfolders:
      -Accounting
      -Marketing
      -HR
      -IT
   -Shared the folder with the Domain Local group of each type.
   -Removed everyone for permissions
    HR/properties/advanced sharing/check box "Share this folder"/
    permissions/remove "everyone"/add HR DL/check box "full controll"
   -file explorer/Network/winServer4b/Top Shelf/ security/add Domain Users/
    full control-Success!
   Alex HR signed onto Client Server and accessed the HR folder and created a new folder.
   -winServer4b/Server Manager/Manage/Server Roles/Expand File and Storage Services/check box both 
   "DFS Namespace" & "DFS Replication"
 Day 3
   -Install/Tools/DFS Management/Namespaces/right click/New Namespace/
    Enter server name "winServer4b"/Name "DFSnamespace/Create namespace
   -Added folder "DFS Test" to our namespace/Add folder target "Top Shelf"
   -Unable to add the subfolder of Top Shelf. Said the subfolders didn't exist and access was denied.
   -Under DFS Test/Add Namespace Server on the right hand side/
   -Added winServer4 - Success!
   -Replication/New Replication Group/named "Company Files" for name of replication group/
    Next/Add Server - ERROR! "Value does not fall within the expected range"
 Day 4
   -We had to set up DFS on the main server WinServer4 which made it to where we could see the replication
    was working. But when we tried to create a new replication group under winServer4b, we still got the 
    same error message although it should've worked just fine.
   

Conclusion and Reflection:
  This lab seemed to have ended up being more complicated than intended. Everyone was running into trouble
  with it. I guess the thing I learned in this lab is that replication is quite handy and simpler to set up 
  than a file sharing system when it is working properly.
