Shea Clark, Alexandra

Objectives: The objective of this lab was to create a virtual machine on Hyper4.

Equipment List: Dell rack servers
 DVD Installation of ProxMox VE
 Browser to remotely connect to ProxMox virtual environment
 ISO file of Window Server 2016 to install VM
 Remote Desktop to access WinServer 2016

Questions: 
1. What settings did you change on Windows Server after it was installed?
After the install we went to the Server Manager and enabled remote access.

2. List your Computer name, IPv4 address, Subnet mask, Gateway address, and DNS addresses.
Hyper4
IP 10.136.212.45
Subnet 255.255.252.0
Gateway 10.136.212.1
DNS 10.133.253.130

3. What is the Ethernet address (physical address) for your network interface?
10.136.212.54

4. Based on the IP information what is the network id of the lab’s network?
10.136.212

5. Based on the IP information what is the host id of your computer?
54

6. What is the range of the host IP addresses on this subnet?
10.136.212.1                              10.136.151.254
10011010.10101010.100101 00.00000001      10011010.10101010.100101 11.11111110

7. What is the purpose of the Default Gateway?
The purpose of the Default Gateway is to serve as an access point to communicate with the internet or computers on another network.

8. What symptoms would you expect if you didn’t have a valid Default Gateway address entered
on your computer’s IP configuration?
Probably wouldn't be able to communicate outside of the network.

Notes and Observations: 

With this lab, Alexandra and I ran into a few problems. The first one being that when we booted up the bios, it said
that it only recognized one of the two harddrives. Which you ended up going ahead and taking out of the harddrives.
Then when we tried to install Proxmox, it kept running into error of being unable to partition harddisk. Whatever that means.
To fix this we had to clear the foreign config and initialize virtual disk.
Then rebooted and install was finally able to complete.

Once we logged into Proxmox and got access to hyper4, we used WinSCP to transfer a file to hyper4 to install Windows OS.
We then created our virtual machine and called it winServer4.
We had to set the Cores to 4 and Memory to 8192 Mb.

We went to Console and installed Windows. After install we logged into winServer4 and changed our IP to 10.136.212.54
Finally, we went to ServerManager and enabled remote access.

Conclusion and Reflection: 
When running into errors, there is a lot of rebooting and waiting that takes place. It was also nice have 3 different groups 
working on the same thing/running into the same problems. We were able to consult with one another and problem solve our errors
collectively. It was a good experience in learning how to set up a virtual machine that will provide a good backup solution.
