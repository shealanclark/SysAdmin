Objectives: Create a new domain and add organizational units
and users.

Equipment List: Lab Computer, Hyper4, Windows 10 os.

Questions:

Notes and Observations: For this lab the first thing we did
go to "Server Manager" and "Add Role -> Active Directory
Domain Services -> Install

This is when we added a new "forest" for our domain although we
actually only have one "tree" for it. 
    Root Domain name: domain4.local

Then we needed to create our first "Organizational Unit".
  Server Manager -> Tools -> Active Directory Users and Computers
  -> Create Organizational Unit -> "First OU" -> create users
 
My new user name I created was "sheaclark@domain4.local"

Next we created a new Virtual Machine called "Win4Client" and
used WinSCP to transfer the Windows 10 os to it.


Conclusion and Reflection:
