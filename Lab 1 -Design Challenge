Objectives: The objective of this lab was to be able to divide up a network in the most efficient way to 
accomodate 4 different companies varying in size.

Notes and Observations: The first thing we did to design this network was figure out how many bits we would need to borrow for each
of the 4 companies. We started with the large company(5,000 nodes). We calculated that we should give them quite a bit extra since they
would be likely to have the most rapid growth out of all of the companies. Then we just moved from largest to smallest.
Large company(5,000 nodes): 13 bits
Medium-Large company(1,500 nodes): 11 bits
Medium company(200 nodes): 9 bits
Small company(50 nodes): 7 bits

It turns out that we ended up wasting more than needed with the small company.
Next we came up with a network diagram. With the diagram we had the happy accident of reserving the address blocks for the companies in
such a way that it would easily allow us to expand by adding the address block next to it.

Next we worked on the summary sheets. All I really contributed to this part was the /# of the subnets. Justin did the rest. I could see
how he was coming up with the addresses, but it still confuses me.

Conclusion and Reflection: This was a challenging lab for me since networking is still pretty muddy for me to understand.
Thankfully Justin understood the process. Sometimes he would get lost in the process of dividing up the network, but I was able to point out
small details that he overlooked. So overall we didn't make a bad team.
